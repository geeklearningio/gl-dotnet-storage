# Geek Learning Cloud Storage Abstraction

This library abstracts physical data storage in a way which allows you to transparently switch the underlying provider
by configuration.

## Features

* List files, with globbing support
* Read, Write, Delete files
* Public file url
 
## Providers

The library currently supports:
* Azure Blob Storage
* File System Storage

We don't support for Amazon S3, but it is one of our high priority objective.
